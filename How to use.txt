Utilizer is a software that works based on a greedy algorithm which finds the orientation 
of the boxes to be kept inside Truck/Roll cages for optimal packing.
Utilizer takes care of the constraints like not rotating Length-by-height/Breadth-by-height, stacking norms etc.

Copy the contents of the CD/Repo somewhere in your C drive. 
It is not possible to run Utilizer directly from the CD since windows does not allow writing to non rewritable CDs.
Open the file t.txt and input the data in the follwing format.
truck length, truck height, truck breadth
1. [First CFC length], [First CFC height], [First CFC breadth], [Number of such CFCs]
2. [Second CFC length], [Second CFC height], [second CFC breadth], [Number of such CFCs]

and so on.

example:
110 192 101
1. 23, 23, 23, 331
2. 53, 21, 43, 431

Run the file main.exe and the results will be displayed with no of packed roll cages.
Open the file t.txt.out to visualize the results.
