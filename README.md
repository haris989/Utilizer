# Utilizer
Optimal packing is an important need of most of the organizations who need to pack cuboid items for transporting goods from one place to the other. Utilizer is a software which suggests the orientation of the cartons inside a container so as to pack them for optimal packing. Since most of the companies have stacking norms for their products, Utilizer does not rotate the cartons in height. Enjoy Packing!
